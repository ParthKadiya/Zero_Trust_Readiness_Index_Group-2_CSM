# üß† Developing a Zero Trust Readiness Index (ZTRI) to Measure Enterprise-wide Zero Trust Adoption

## üìò Overview
This repository presents the research and supporting data for the paper **‚ÄúDeveloping a Zero Trust Readiness Index (ZTRI) to Measure Enterprise-wide Zero Trust Adoption.‚Äù**  
The study introduces a structured, quantifiable framework to evaluate organizational readiness for Zero Trust implementation across eight core dimensions of cybersecurity maturity.

The ZTRI model builds on insights from **ten academic and industry research papers** through a **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)** approach.  
By transforming qualitative findings from prior works into a **quantitative weighted readiness index**, this project provides a reproducible and evidence-based method to assess how far an enterprise has progressed toward Zero Trust adoption.

## üéØ Research Objective
The primary goal of this research is to establish a **measurable Zero Trust Readiness Index (ZTRI)** capable of quantifying the maturity of organizational Zero Trust initiatives.  
It seeks to answer:
- What are the most critical dimensions influencing Zero Trust adoption?
- How can these qualitative factors be represented numerically to produce a readiness score?

## üß© Methodology
This research applies a **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)** across ten selected academic and industry publications that address Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), maturity models, and readiness assessment frameworks.

**Key methodological steps:**
1. **Systematic Review (SLR):** Identification and analysis of 10 peer-reviewed and authoritative sources on Zero Trust maturity and CSF frameworks.  
2. **Frequency-based Weighting:** Extraction of mentions and significance of each of the eight Zero Trust dimensions across all papers.  
3. **Normalization:** Conversion of total frequency counts into proportional weights that sum to 1.0.  
4. **Readiness Scoring:** Application of a 1‚Äì5 Likert scale (Non-existent ‚Üí Optimized) to rate organizations, combined with weighted values to compute an overall readiness score.

**Eight Zero Trust Dimensions:**
- Identity  
- Endpoints  
- Applications  
- Infrastructure  
- Data  
- Networks  
- Visibility & Analytics  
- Automation & Orchestration

## üí° Novelty and Contribution
This research extends the foundational work of **Yeoh et al. (2023)** ‚Äî *‚ÄúZero Trust Cybersecurity: Critical Success Factors and a Maturity Assessment Framework‚Äù* ‚Äî by transforming its **qualitative Delphi-based model** into a **quantitative scoring matrix**.

**Novel Contributions:**
- Introduces a **Zero Trust Readiness Index (ZTRI)** combining SLR-based weights with quantitative scoring.  
- Translates theoretical maturity factors into **measurable organizational indicators**.  
- Enables practitioners and researchers to compare readiness levels across industries using standardized metrics.  

The ZTRI framework thus bridges the gap between **academic Zero Trust theory** and **practical enterprise assessment**.

## üßÆ How to Use
1. Open the included Excel file: `ZTRI_Scoring_Calculation.xlsx`.  
2. For each of the eight dimensions, assign a readiness score from **1 (Non-existent)** to **5 (Optimized)**.  
3. The weighted score and overall readiness index will be calculated automatically.  
4. The resulting **ZTRI value (0‚Äì5)** represents the organization‚Äôs overall Zero Trust maturity level.
