# Developing a Zero Trust Readiness Index (ZTRI)
**A framework to measure enterprise-wide Zero Trust adoption (Group - 2 - CSM)**

---

## Project Overview
This repository shows a complete implementation of the **Zero Trust Readiness Index (ZTRI)** a systematic, data-driven method to calculate how ready an organization is to adopt or enhance a **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)**.

The project combines **academic research** and **practical scoring tools** to calculate a readiness score (0–5) across **8 key Zero Trust dimensions**, using a **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)** method.

## Research Summary

### Objective
To design a **Zero Trust Readiness Index (ZTRI)** that:
- Quantifies readiness using weighted maturity scores.
- Identifies organizational strengths and gaps across Zero Trust dimensions.
- Provides a consistent measurement method aligned with modern ZTA principles.

### Methodology
1. Conducted a **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)** of 10 Zero Trust–related research papers.
2. Extracted **8 common Zero Trust dimensions**:
   - Identity  
   - Endpoints  
   - Applications  
   - Infrastructure  
   - Data  
   - Networks  
   - Visibility & Analytics  
   - Automation & Orchestration
3. Counted dimension frequencies (Critical, High, Medium) across all papers.
4. Normalized frequency totals to produce **weighted importance values (sum = 1.00)**.
5. Created a **scoring model (0–5)** and an Excel tool to automate readiness evaluation.

## Scoring Model

| Score | Category | Description |
|:------:|-----------|-------------|
| 0 | Non-Existent | No implementation or awareness. |
| 1 | Initial | Early-stage, ad-hoc efforts. |
| 2 | Basic | Defined goals but inconsistent practices. |
| 3 | Intermediate | Structured and measurable controls. |
| 4 | Advanced | Integrated Zero Trust adoption. |
| 5 | Optimised | Fully automated and monitored ZT ecosystem. |

### Formula
```
Weighted Score = Dimension Weight × Dimension Score
Total Readiness = Σ (Weighted Scores)
```

The resulting **Total Readiness Score (0–5)** is automatically classified into the readiness category.

## How to Use

1. **Review the Docs** →  
   Understand the scoring logic (`/docs/02_Readiness_Scoring_Logic.md`) and findings.

2. **Input Organization Scores** →  
   Open the Excel file:
   ```
   /excel-model/ZTRI_Scoring_Model_v1.xlsx
   ```
   Enter a value (0–5) for each dimension.  
   The sheet automatically calculates:
   - Weighted Score per dimension  
   - Overall Readiness Score  
   - Readiness Category  

3. **Visualize Results** →  
   Explore `/visuals/` for charts and flow diagrams.

## Example Output

| Dimension | Weight | Score | Weighted Score |
|------------|---------|-------|----------------|
| Identity | 0.22 | 4 | 0.88 |
| Data | 0.18 | 3 | 0.54 |
| Applications | 0.15 | 3 | 0.45 |
| Endpoints | 0.10 | 2 | 0.20 |
| Infrastructure | 0.10 | 3 | 0.30 |
| Networks | 0.14 | 4 | 0.56 |
| Visibility & Analytics | 0.07 | 2 | 0.14 |
| Automation & Orchestration | 0.04 | 1 | 0.04 |
| **Total Readiness Score** | | | **3.11 / 5 (Intermediate)** |
