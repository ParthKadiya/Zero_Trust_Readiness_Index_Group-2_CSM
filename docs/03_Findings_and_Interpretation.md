# Findings and Interpretation

## Purpose
This section tells the overall Zero Trust Readiness Score and provides view into what the score means for an organization’s current security posture.  
The goal is to convert numerical results into actionable guidance, helping identify which Zero Trust dimensions are strong, which need improvement, and what steps to take next.

## Score Interpretation

The final **Zero Trust Readiness Score** (0–5) tells how well an organization’s people, processes, and technologies align with the Zero Trust framework.

| Score Range | Readiness Category | Interpretation |
|--------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **0.00 – 0.99** | Non-Existent | The organization lacks Zero Trust awareness or any formal security controls aligned with its principles. Foundational identity and access management (IAM) policies must be established. |
| **1.00 – 1.99** | Initial | Awareness has started but adoption is fragmented. Controls may exist in silos without centralized enforcement or visibility. |
| **2.00 – 2.99** | Basic | Partial implementation of Zero Trust practices. Core elements such as identity and network segmentation are emerging but not yet mature. |
| **3.00 – 3.99** | Intermediate | The organization demonstrates structured Zero Trust adoption with defined processes and measurable maturity. Visibility, analytics, and automation need improvement. |
| **4.00 – 4.49** | Advanced | Zero Trust architecture is well-integrated and consistent across users, data, and devices. Strong governance and automated enforcement exist, but full orchestration is pending. |
| **4.50 – 5.00** | Optimised | Zero Trust is fully operational, continuously monitored, and data-driven. Automation and orchestration ensure proactive risk mitigation and adaptive controls. |

## Dimension-wise Interpretation

| Dimension | Low Score Meaning | High Score Meaning |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Identity** | Weak authentication, minimal identity governance, lack of MFA or privilege controls. | Mature IAM framework with adaptive access, continuous verification, and privileged access management. |
| **Endpoints** | Limited visibility over devices, no posture validation, unmonitored assets. | All endpoints managed, monitored, and protected with continuous compliance checks. |
| **Applications** | No unified access control or app-layer segmentation. | Centralized access policies, secure APIs, and continuous application-level monitoring. |
| **Infrastructure** | Flat networks and manual configurations. | Segmented, automated infrastructure with policy-as-code and real-time configuration compliance. |
| **Data** | Data unclassified or stored insecurely. | Full data classification, encryption, and continuous DLP enforcement. |
| **Networks** | No segmentation; excessive trust within internal networks. | Dynamic segmentation, micro-perimeters, and secure routing with context-based policies. |
| **Visibility & Analytics** | Lack of centralized monitoring and threat analytics. | Unified monitoring dashboards and analytics for continuous assessment of trust levels. |
| **Automation & Orchestration** | Manual policy application and reactive incident response. | Fully automated policy orchestration, adaptive controls, and SOAR-based response workflows. |

## Interpreting the Results

- **High Weighted Score:** This shows mature implementation aligned with Zero Trust principles.  
- **Low Weighted Score:** This shows areas where adoption is limited or inconsistent.  
- **High-Weight + Low-Score Dimensions:** This Should be treated as **priority improvement areas**, since they largely impact the overall readiness score.

## Recommendations

| Readiness Category | Recommended Actions |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Non-Existent / Initial** | Establish Zero Trust governance, baseline identity management, and network access controls. Begin user awareness training. |
| **Basic** | Implement centralized IAM, MFA, and initial data protection policies. Start monitoring endpoints and network activity. |
| **Intermediate** | Introduce automation and analytics for continuous monitoring. Strengthen policy enforcement and visibility. |
| **Advanced** | Integrate full orchestration between identity, data, and network systems. Expand automated remediation and compliance checks. |
| **Optimised** | Maintain continuous improvement through real-time analytics, AI-driven automation, and proactive threat modeling. |

## Summary

- The **ZTRI Score** transform qualitative Zero Trust maturity into a quantifiable readiness measure (0–5).  
- Each dimension contributes based on its academic weight.  
- The final score helps organizations benchmark their Zero Trust posture and prioritize investments.  
- Continuous reassessment is recommended as Zero Trust implementation evolves.
