# 8 Zero Trust Dimensions (According to Yeoh et al., 2023)

These eight dimensions represent the **core pillars of Zero Trust maturity**.  
They are applied in the baseline model to measure readiness across **technology, organization, and culture**.

---

## 1. Identity
Guarantees that no user, device, or service is allowed to access the system unless it has been validated and granted permission.  
Identity verification, access governance, and authentication are central to enforcing the principle of *“never trust, always verify.”*

---

## 2. Endpoints
Continuous monitoring is used to safeguard network-connected machines from intrusions and anomalies.  
Endpoint protection, compliance visibility, and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) play a vital role in maintaining Zero Trust integrity.

---

## 3. Applications
Implements **least privilege** and **micro-segmentation** to tightly restrict access at the application layer.  
Ensures that workloads, APIs, and services interact securely under adaptive policy-based control.

---

## 4. Data
Encryption safeguards sensitive information **in storage, in transit, and in use**.  
Data classification, DLP (Data Loss Prevention), and encryption frameworks ensure that data remains protected at every stage of the lifecycle.

---

## 5. Network
Network segmentation, encrypted traffic, and visibility mechanisms are key measures of Zero Trust enforcement.  
These controls limit lateral movement, improve traceability, and enforce granular access control.

---

## 6. Infrastructure
Protects the underlying cloud, virtualization, and on-premise systems that support Zero Trust operations.  
Ensures that configurations are securely provisioned and resilient to misconfigurations or unauthorized changes.

---

## 7. Visibility & Analytics
Empowers continuous threat detection and monitoring through **AI-driven analytics** and **telemetry integration**.  
Visibility enables organizations to identify anomalous behavior and dynamically adjust access based on real-time risk assessment.

---

## 8. Automation & Orchestration
Combines **response automation** and **policy orchestration** to enhance system resilience and reduce human error.  
Automation ensures consistency, scalability, and faster containment of potential security incidents.

---

### Summary
These **eight dimensions** form the **foundation of the Zero Trust Readiness Index (ZTRI)** model.  
They collectively represent the technical and organizational areas through which **Zero Trust maturity** is measured and continuously improved.
