8 Zero Trust Dimensions (According to Yeoh et al., 2023)

These eight dimensions represent the core pillars of Zero Trust maturity.
They are applied in the baseline model to measure readiness across technology, organization, and culture.

1. Identity

Ensuring that the system cannot be accessed by any user, device, or service unless it is a verified and permitted active user.
The core principle of the principle of never trust, always verify is implemented by identity verification, access governance, and authentication.

2. Endpoints

Constant surveillance is employed in order to protect networked machines against intrusion and anomalies.
Protecting the endpoint, visibility of compliance, as well as EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) has a critical role in ensuring integrity with Zero Trust.

3. Applications

Implements least privilege and micro-segmentation to tightly restrict access at the application layer.
Ensures that workloads, APIs, and services interact securely under adaptive policy-based control.

4. Data

Sensitive information is protected by encryption once in storage, transmission and use.
Data classification, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and encryption models are used to make sure that a data is not broken at any point in its lifecycle.

5. Network

The major measures of Zero Trust enforcement are network segmentation, encrypted traffic, and visibility mechanisms.
Such controls restrict the outward movement, enhance traceability as well as implementing the Pero-granular access control.

6. Infrastructure

Secures the cloud, virtualization, and on-premise frameworks on which Zero Trust functions takes place.
Enhances the provisioning assures a secure configuration and is robust to misconfiguration or unauthorised adjustments.

7. Visibility & Analytics

Empowers continuous threat detection and monitoring through AI-driven analytics and telemetry integration.
Visibility enables organizations to identify anomalous behavior and dynamically adjust access based on real-time risk assessment.

8. Automation & Orchestration

Combines response automation and policy orchestration to enhance system resilience and reduce human error.
Automation ensures consistency, scalability, and faster containment of potential security incidents.
