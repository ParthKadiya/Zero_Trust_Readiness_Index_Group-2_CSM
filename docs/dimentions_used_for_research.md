# 8 Zero Trust Dimensions (According to Yeoh et al., 2023)

These eight dimensions represent the **core pillars of Zero Trust maturity**.  
They are applied in the baseline model to measure readiness across **technology, organization, and culture**.

---

## Identity
Ensuring that the system cannot be accessed by any user, device, or service unless it is a verified and permitted active user.  
The core principle of *never trust, always verify* is implemented by identity verification, access governance, and authentication.

---

## Endpoints
Constant surveillance is employed in order to protect networked machines against intrusion and anomalies.  
Protecting the endpoint, visibility of compliance, as well as EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) has a critical role in ensuring integrity with Zero Trust.

---

## Applications
Implements *least privilege* and *micro-segmentation* to tightly restrict access at the application layer.  
Ensures that workloads, APIs, and services interact securely under adaptive policy-based control.

---

## Data
Sensitive information is protected by encryption once in storage, transmission and use.  
Data classification, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and encryption models are used to make sure that data is not broken at any point in its lifecycle.

---

## Network
The major measures of Zero Trust enforcement are network segmentation, encrypted traffic, and visibility mechanisms.  
Such controls restrict outward movement, enhance traceability, as well as implement **per-granular** access control.

---

## Infrastructure
Secures the cloud, virtualization, and on-premise frameworks on which Zero Trust functions take place.  
Enhances the provisioning, assures a secure configuration, and is robust to misconfiguration or unauthorised adjustments.

---

## Visibility & Analytics
Empowers continuous threat detection and monitoring through **AI-driven analytics** and **telemetry integration**.  
Visibility enables organizations to identify anomalous behavior and dynamically adjust access based on real-time risk assessment.

---

## Automation & Orchestration
Combines **response automation** and **policy orchestration** to enhance system resilience and reduce human error.  
Automation ensures consistency, scalability, and faster containment of potential security incidents.
